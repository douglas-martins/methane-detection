"""R2 subsample construction (plan Section 0.1): a seeded, scene-disjoint slice of
`starcop_raw` for the training/evaluation stages, without reprocessing anything.

Sampling unit is the flightline (`name` column) -- the same unit
`split.py`'s `stratify_by` already splits `starcop_raw`'s own train/val/test
on, so R2's scene-disjointness from raw's val/test is inherited for free
rather than re-derived here. This is a pure row filter over
`patch_extract@starcop_raw`'s already-built patches CSV -- no new DVC
stage, no `configs/dataset/*.yaml` entry (Section 0.1's own decision).
