"""Pixel-level metrics for the DL course final project (plan Section 6/8).

`pixel_f1` is the one curve Section 6 logs during training. Section 8's
fuller metric suite (Precision/Recall/F1/confusion matrix, PR-AUC, and a
per-patch "detected at all" summary, on val *and* test, per configuration)
is built on the same kind of pooled TP/FP/FN/TN counts, factored out here
so every call site shares one definition of the counts instead of computing
them twice: `confusion_matrix_counts`/`*_from_counts` for the fixed-threshold
metrics, `sweep_confusion_counts`/`*_from_sweep` for the PR-AUC threshold
sweep, `patch_detection_counts`/`detection_rate_from_counts` for the
per-patch summary.

**Reuse decision (Section 8's own "check whether it can be called directly"
note)**: `vendor/starcop/starcop/metrics.py` already implements the same
`precision`/`recall`/`f1score` math over a `[[TN, FP], [FN, TP]]` tensor
(consumed via a seam file in `src/baselines/starcop/evaluation/
paper_metrics.py`). Not imported here: every other coursework module is
self-contained by design (plan Section 0 -- no `src/`/`vendor/` imports
anywhere in `coursework/`, unlike `src/`'s own per-package `_vendor_starcop*.py`
seam convention), and the math itself is a handful of lines with no
STARCOP-specific coupling. `confusion_matrix_from_counts` below matches
vendor's exact `[[TN, FP], [FN, TP]]` layout so a result computed here would
still line up with the thesis's own convention if ever compared side by side.
