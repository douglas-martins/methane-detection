"""The STARCOP paper's evaluation protocol, as pure functions over per-scene counts (plan Phase 3).

Input is the output of `scene_inference.score_scenes`: an integer array `counts` of shape
`(n_scenes, n_thresholds, 4)` holding `[tp, fp, fn, tn]` pixels per scene and threshold, plus one
bucket label per scene (`scene_manifest.assign_bucket`: `strong`, `weak` or `plume_free`).

Definitions (STARCOP, Semantic segmentation of methane plumes with hyperspectral machine
learning models, Sci. Rep. 13:19999, 2023 -- section "Metrics", p. 8; checked against this
project's earlier reproduction, `src/baselines/starcop/evaluation/paper_metrics.py`, which
was validated against real STARCOP runs, and against the released `test.csv`):

- **strong / weak F1**: precision, recall and F1 of the pixels *pooled over the scenes of the
  bucket* (not the mean of per-scene F1). Strong plumes are scenes with an emission rate of
  at least 1000 kg/h (`test.csv`'s `difficulty == "easy"`), weak plumes the other plume scenes.
- **tile FPR**: the fraction of plume-free scenes ("tiles") that the model marks as containing
  a plume; a tile is marked when its thresholded prediction has *more than 10 active pixels*.
- **AUPRC**: the paper names it without fixing the integration convention. This project uses
  the non-interpolated (step-function) average precision of the pooled pixel counts over a
  threshold grid, `metrics.average_precision_from_sweep`, the same convention as the thesis's
  own reproduction. The result depends on the grid, so it is reported on three
  (`AUPRC_GRIDS`), and on two populations (every scene, or plume scenes only).
- **captured plumes** (a secondary count the paper mentions but does not tabulate): a plume
  scene whose tile is marked (more than 10 active pixels) and whose prediction overlaps the
  label by at least one pixel. This is this project's operationalisation.
