"""Choosing the operating threshold on validation, and applying it once to test (plan Phase 4).

The threshold that goes with a reported test number must be picked on data the number is *not*
computed on. `select_threshold` therefore only ever sees validation counts (its signature has no
other input, and a test pins that), and `apply_threshold` reports test metrics at the chosen
threshold. The old `threshold_calibration.py` picks its threshold from the *test* precision-recall
curve -- an oracle, optimistic by construction; `oracle_threshold` here is the same search on any
split, named so it cannot be mistaken for a validation-picked one.

Objective (plan decision D2): the F1 of the pixels pooled over **all** validation scenes,
plume-free ones included (`"pooled_f1"`). `"plume_scenes_f1"` pools strong and weak scenes only;
it is a sensitivity analysis, not the headline.

Grid-edge guard: a pick on the first or last threshold of the grid means the best threshold may
lie beyond it. Counts on a fixed grid cannot be widened offline, so `select_with_widening` takes a
`rescore(grid)` callback that produces validation counts for a wider logit grid, and repeats.
