"""Scene-level manifests for the paper-protocol evaluation (plan: paper-protocol eval, Phase 1).

The papers score whole 512x512 scenes; this project trains and (until now) evaluated on
128x128 patches cut from them. The patch manifests carry a *patch-level* `has_plume`, so the
scene-level truth -- `has_plume`, `qplume` and the strong/weak/plume-free bucket -- has to be
re-joined from the papers' own scene CSVs (`test.csv`; `train.csv` for the validation scenes).
One manifest row per parent scene, in the same column layout `PatchDataset` reads, so a
scene manifest can be fed to it directly (window = the whole scene).

Bucket definitions follow the STARCOP paper's evaluation: strong plumes are emissions of at
least 1000 kg/h, weak plumes are the remaining positive scenes, and plume-free scenes are
those without an emission.
