"""Helpers for the regression checks of the paper-protocol evaluation (plan Phase 5).

The `patches` diagnostic of `scene_inference` sums per-patch counts, so a pixel is counted once for
every 128x128 patch (stride 64) that contains it. These functions compute, from the labels alone
and independently of any model, how many times each pixel is counted -- which pins down exactly
what the patch-mode positive and total pixel counts of a scene must be.
