"""Training loop for the DL course final project (plan Section 6/7).

Thin glue over the already-tested pieces (`dataset.py`, `losses.py`,
`early_stopping.py`, `metrics.py`) -- exercised by real recorded runs
(mini baseline training, R1 raw smoke training, R2 subsample training),
not deep unit coverage, matching this repo's own established "thin glue
vs. tested logic" pattern (see `src/baselines/starcop/serving/service.py`,
`train.py`).

MLflow tracking uses a SQLite backend
(`sqlite:///coursework/dl-final-project/mlflow.db`), not the plain
`file:./mlruns` the plan's early sections describe -- the installed
MLflow (3.14) now raises by default on the filesystem backend
(maintenance-mode only), and the tracking URI is explicit and
coursework-scoped so it can never collide with this repo's own
pre-existing root-level `mlruns/` (real thesis experiment data).

    `state_path` (optional) makes the run **exactly resumable**: after every epoch
    the full training state (model, optimizer, epoch and step counters, both early
    stoppers, best metrics, main-process RNG states, elapsed time and a run
    signature) is written atomically to that file. `resume_state=True` reloads it
    and continues bit-identically to an uninterrupted run, because the two other
    sources of randomness are pure functions of `(seed, epoch[, index])`:
    `EpochShuffleSampler` for the shuffle order and `PatchDataset(augment_seed=...)`
    for augmentation. A resume is refused when `state_path` is missing, when it is
    combined with the weights-only `resume_from`, or when the saved signature
    (`run_signature()`) differs from the current run; a fresh run (`resume_state=
    False`) refuses to overwrite an existing state file. `max_epochs` and `patience`
    may change on resume (extending a run that hit its cap is the intended use).
    The best-checkpoint file at `checkpoint_path` is only ever rewritten by an epoch
    that is a new best, exactly as in an uninterrupted run.

    `progress_every` (optional, default `None` = off) prints a mid-epoch
    heartbeat line every that many (cumulative) steps when `verbose=True`
    -- a `raw-full` epoch takes ~15 minutes and otherwise prints nothing
    until it finishes. Harmless to leave off for `mini`/`r2`, whose
    epochs are already short (25-380 steps) and finish before a
    reasonably-sized interval would ever fire.

    `max_val_batches` (plan Section 7.1 Phase A4, default `None` = full
    val split) is forwarded to every `evaluate()` call this makes -- for
    dry-running a cell at `tier=raw-full` with `max_steps=2`, so the val
    pass doesn't still walk all 26,607 patches every "epoch" (`raw-smoke`
    already had its own escape hatch for this via a pre-sliced `val_df` in
    `_load_split`; this is the general version for any tier).

    `seed` (plan Section 7.1 Phase A1) is applied via `set_seed()` before
    the loaders are built and also seeds `EpochShuffleSampler` (shuffle order)
    and `PatchDataset(augment_seed=...)` (augmentation), so calling `fit()`
    twice with the same seed and the same starting model weights reproduces the
    same shuffle order, augmentation draws, and therefore the same metrics. It does **not**
    seed the model's own weight initialization -- that already happened
    before `model` was passed in; call `set_seed()` yourself before
    building the model if that also needs to be reproducible (`main()`
    does this).

    `wall_clock_seconds` (total) and `seconds_per_epoch` (average; also
    logged per-epoch to MLflow individually) are returned so Section 7's
    R3 epoch-cap sizing can be based on a number this function actually
    measured, not the `stats.py` I/O-timing estimate carried forward in
    that section's own prose (plan Section 7.1 Phase A3).

    `num_workers=0` (the default) is right for tests -- worker-process
    startup is pure overhead against a handful of synthetic patches. Real
    training runs should pass `num_workers>0`: with `PatchDataset`'s
    per-item rasterio reads, a single-process loader re-reads every patch
    from disk every epoch serially -- measured at ~8s/epoch on
    `starcop_mini`'s 392 patches before `PatchDataset` cached decoded
    patches per index; `num_workers=4` with `persistent_workers=True` (on
    the train loader; see below) cuts that further to ~1.5-2s/epoch (real
    GeoTIFFs, not a synthetic fixture) by parallelizing that I/O across
    worker processes that stay alive between epochs instead of respawning
    every time.

    **`num_workers` applies to both the train and val loader, but only the
    train loader's pool is `persistent_workers=True`.** The train loader
    iterates every epoch, so keeping its workers alive avoids re-spawning
    them each time; the val loader runs once per epoch right after it, so a
    *second* full persistent pool held alive for the whole call would just
    double concurrent worker processes for no benefit. That doubling is
    exactly what measurably thrashed this machine's 12-thread CPU at
    `num_workers=8` (16 workers total, both persistent at the time) -- a
    300-step + one-eval smoke run went from ~18s isolated to hanging past a
    200s timeout; `num_workers=4` (8 total, both persistent at the time)
    was verified fast for the same real workload. Keep `num_workers * 2`
    comfortably under the machine's thread count regardless.

    Both loaders also auto-detect a matching `patch_cache`-built on-disk
    cache under `_CACHE_ROOT/<dataset>/{train,val}` (`patch_cache.
    resolve_cache_dir`) and use it transparently when present -- this is
    what actually fixes `starcop_raw`'s disk-I/O bottleneck (benchmarked
    ~95x faster than the live GeoTIFF read it replaces), since the RAM
    cache above barely helps at that scale (see `patch_cache.py`'s own
    docstring). Falls back to live reads with no error when no matching
    cache exists (a tier whose data doesn't match what was cached, e.g.
    `r2`'s subsample or `raw-smoke`'s sliced val, or simply nothing
    precomputed yet) -- build one with `precompute_patch_cache.py`.

    `monitor` (default `"val_loss"`, or `"val_f1"`) is the `evaluate()` key
    early stopping and checkpoint selection track -- `"val_loss"` picks the
    epoch with the lowest val loss (`EarlyStopper(mode="min")`), `"val_f1"`
    the epoch with the highest val F1 (`mode="max"`). Found for real
    reviewing R2/R3 (report.md's "Extensão do valor de épocas"/
    "Calibração de limiar" follow-up): under `starcop_raw`'s much larger
    `pos_weight` (~270-314, vs. ~87 on `mini`) and its huge, overwhelmingly-
    negative val split, `BCEWithLogitsLoss`'s mean-reduced value stops
    tracking segmentation quality -- every R2/R3 run had an epoch a few
    steps from the loss-selected one with 21-39% better F1. `mini` keeps
    the default: its own divergence was small, and its 49-patch val split
    (9 positive) makes raw F1 too noisy per-epoch to select on directly
    (confirmed: an untrained epoch-1 checkpoint scored `val_f1=0.78` on
    9 positive patches purely by chance, alongside a `val_loss=0.44` that
    correctly showed it was still untrained).

    When `monitor="val_f1"`, stopping *also* requires `val_loss`'s own
    patience to be independently exhausted -- checkpoint selection stays
    on raw, unsmoothed `val_f1` (`stopper.is_best` below is untouched),
    only the stop decision gets this second condition. Replaces an
    earlier attempt at fixing the same problem via a smoothed/windowed
    `val_f1` average: that fixed `E2-raw-full` (see above) but broke
    `E1-r2` -- smoothing pulled the *selected* checkpoint away from a
    genuinely good, isolated F1 spike (confirmed by scoring worse on the
    real test split than even plain `val_loss` monitoring), because
    averaging conflates "should we stop" with "which epoch is best" into
    one number. Tracking `val_loss` as a second, independent stop
    condition can only extend training (never change *which* epoch's raw
    F1 ends up selected), so it can't repeat that mistake: `E2-raw-full`
    stopped at epoch 14 because F1 hadn't beaten its epoch-4 spike in
    `patience` epochs, even though `val_loss` was still finding new minima
    through epoch 12 -- proof the model hadn't actually plateaued yet.

    `resume_from` (optional path, default `None`) warm-starts `model`'s
    weights from a previously-saved checkpoint before training begins --
    added after a real GPU driver crash (`cudaErrorLaunchTimeout`) lost an
    in-progress `raw-full` (R3) run partway through (72 epochs in, best
    `val_f1` already far ahead of any prior attempt). Not a full resume:
    only weights are restored, not the optimizer/epoch-counter/early-
    stopping state -- Adam's own momentum re-adapts within a handful of
    steps, and a true resume would mean changing the checkpoint file
    format (currently a bare `state_dict`, loaded the same way by every
    other caller in this project, e.g. `evaluate.py`'s `load_checkpoint`).
    The new run's own `EarlyStopper`(s) start fresh and epoch numbering
    restarts at 1, but before epoch 1 the resumed weights are scored once
    on the val split ("epoch 0", also logged to MLflow at `step=0`) and that
    score seeds the stoppers' starting "best", with the weights written to
    `checkpoint_path`. An epoch therefore only replaces `checkpoint_path`
    if it beats the resumed weights on `monitor`; if none does, the result
    is the baseline's metrics with `best_epoch=0`. (The first version of
    this skipped the baseline, so epoch 1 always overwrote the checkpoint
    -- even when one epoch of fresh-Adam training left the model worse.)

    Usage: python train.py architecture=E1 dataset=starcop_mini tier=mini [max_steps=300]
           [seed=42] [max_val_batches=2] [max_epochs=20] [patience=10] [monitor=val_loss]
    `tier` is one of 'mini' | 'raw-smoke' | 'r2' -- only affects which split is loaded and,
    for 'raw-smoke', how the run is labeled; `max_steps` (optional) caps step count,
    used for the R1 smoke-training run (a few hundred steps, no convergence expected).
    `seed` (plan Section 7.1 Phase A1, default 42) is applied via `set_seed()` before
    `build_model()` so weight initialization is reproducible too, then passed to `fit()`
    for the loader/augmentation seeding described there.
    `max_val_batches` (plan Section 7.1 Phase A4, optional, default no cap) caps how many
    val batches `evaluate()` reads per epoch -- pair with a small `max_steps` for Phase
    B's dry runs on `tier=raw-full`/`r2`, where a full val pass would otherwise dominate
    the wall-clock time a "smoke test" is supposed to save.
    `max_epochs` (optional, default 50, or 1 when `max_steps` is set) overrides the
    schedule's epoch cap -- added for R3 (plan Section 7 Phase E), whose overnight
    time budget needs a smaller cap than mini/r2's 50 (sized from measured per-step
    cost, not the default). `patience` (optional, default 10) is exposed for
    completeness but R3 keeps it at 10 deliberately -- Section 7's own rule holds
    early-stopping patience fixed across tiers; only the epoch cap is the allowed
    per-tier exception.
    `progress_every` (optional, default no heartbeat) prints a mid-epoch progress
    line every that many cumulative steps -- worth setting for `raw-full`, whose
    ~15-minute epochs otherwise print nothing until they finish.
    `monitor` (optional, default `"val_loss"`, or `"val_f1"`) is passed through to
    `fit()` -- see its own docstring. Along with `max_epochs`, this is a second
    allowed per-tier exception to Section 7's "hold everything but the dataset
    fixed" rule, used for R2/R3 specifically (large enough val splits for F1 to
    be a low-noise selection signal; see report.md's "Calibração de limiar").
    `monitor="val_f1"` also requires `val_loss` to independently plateau before
    stopping -- see `fit()`'s own docstring.
    `resume_from` (optional path, default `None`) is passed through to `fit()`
    -- a manual weights-only warm start (see its docstring); it does NOT
    reproduce the original trajectory. Points at a checkpoint file; the run only
    overwrites `checkpoints/<architecture>-<tier>.pt` with an epoch that beats
    the resumed weights, so resuming from that same path is safe.
    `resume_state` (`true`/`false`, default `false`) continues an interrupted run
    *exactly* from `run_state/<architecture>-<tier>.state.pt` (written after
    every epoch) -- same weights, optimizer, stoppers, RNG streams -- and keeps
    logging into the same MLflow run (its id is kept next to the state file).
    Without it, a leftover state file makes the run refuse to start.
    `train_with_recovery.py` wraps this CLI and relaunches with
    `resume_state=true` automatically after a GPU crash.
