"""**Oracle** threshold calibration for the DL course final project's already-logged
evaluation runs (follow-up to plan Section 8's own PR-curve/threshold-calibration
finding: raw-tier models are recall-heavy at the fixed 0.5 threshold because
`pos_weight` scales with tier -- report.md's "Métricas de avaliação" already
names this and says PR-AUC/curves should lead the raw-tier comparison).

**Read this before citing any number from here.** The F1-optimal threshold is
picked from the *test* split's own precision-recall curve and then scored on that
same split, so the result is an optimistic upper bound (an oracle), not an
operating point a deployed model could actually use. A threshold chosen on the
validation split and applied to test once is `threshold_selection.py`'s job; the
difference between the two is the optimism this module bakes in. Every metric
this logs keeps its `test_calibrated_*` name for traceability to older run ids,
and each run also gets the tag `test_calibrated_is_oracle=true`.

This reports the oracle operating point per run *in addition to* the
fixed-0.5 table already in `report.md`, at zero retraining cost: every
`evaluate.py` run already logs a full 101-point precision-recall sweep as a
`{split}_precision_recall_curve.json` artifact, so the calibrated point is
just a different read of data already on disk.

Thin glue over already-tested logic (`metrics.py`'s `best_f1_operating_point`)
-- exercised by running `main()` for real against the run names `report.md`'s
tables already reference, not deep unit coverage, matching this project's own
established "thin glue vs. tested logic" pattern (`train.py`, `evaluate.py`,
`pr_curve_plots.py`).
