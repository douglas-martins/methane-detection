"""Build and persist the R2 subsample manifests (plan Section 0.1/Section 7).

Run once; the resulting CSVs are committed and reused by every R2 run, not
regenerated per run (a redrawn subsample would silently make R2 runs
non-comparable to each other -- Section 7's own checklist requirement).

`sampling.py`'s `build_r2_manifest` already has full test coverage; this
script is the one real, recorded invocation that produces the actual
artifact, the same "thin glue exercised by a real run" pattern as
`confirm_raw.py`.
