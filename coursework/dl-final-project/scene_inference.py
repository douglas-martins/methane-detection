"""Per-scene confusion counts for the paper-protocol evaluation (plan Phase 2).

The GPU runs **once per (checkpoint, split, mode)** and produces, for every scene, the
`[tp, fp, fn, tn]` pixel counts at every threshold of a grid. Everything downstream (the papers'
strong/weak F1, tile FPR, AUPRC on any grid, the validation-picked threshold) is then offline
arithmetic over these integer counts.

Two modes:
- `"full_scene"` runs the model directly on each whole scene (512x512 in this project), which is
  how the STARCOP paper scores its test set. This is the reported result.
- `"patches"` scores the scene's existing 128x128 patches one by one and sums their counts per
  scene. **A diagnostic only**: it reproduces this project's older patch-pooled protocol broken
  down by scene, so it can be checked against `evaluate.py`. The patches overlap (stride 64), so a
  pixel is counted once per patch that contains it and a scene's pixel total is
  `n_patches * 128 * 128`, not 512 * 512.
